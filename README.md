This group project is a part of training phase in Persistent Systems where we were asked to build a web app with Tech Stack of our choice.

### Tech Stack

- Node
- Express
- MongoDB
- Git

### Functionalities

- Account Creation and Authentication.
- Donate Medicines.
- Raise a request for donated medicines.
- View the donations and Collection Requests.

### To run the app

Create a .env file in the backend source directory and specify the MONGODB URI and PORT NO. After this, use the command `npm run dev` to run the backend.

For frontend, go to the medicinapp-frontend directory and update the request url in the service files with the PORT NO used in backend. Use `npm start` to run the application.
